## HW 11 Question 2 Coding Part

### Jack Chen and Jason Phillips

#### Files

We put all of our helper functions in toolkit.py that help main.py
output the maximum height and proper blocks that it uses to get said height.
The input.txt and output.txt are some input and output tests that we ran.

#### How to run

First compile the code using a compiler, and running the code will make the console 
prompt you to enter an input file (ex: input.txt). The code will then write to a 
user-specified file in the format described in the assignment. In the console,
it will show the process by which the answer is reached and show the answer
itself.
